\opening{Dear Dr. L\"oh:} 
 
\noindent I have been involved with Computer Sciences for the last 7 years. 
During that time I have achieved many goals including a Bachelor's degree in 
Computer Science with a specialization on Distributed Programming, honorific 
mentions granted by ACM and course certificates by IBM. I have participated and developed various Open 
Source projects and have worked with different businesses using Ruby as their 
main language; I would like to accomplish the same tasks using Haskell as my main
development tool. 

\noindent Since my first interactions with Haskell in 2005, I have felt identified with the 
language and the functional programming paradigm in general, because of this, on the last 2 years 
I have been studying it from different sources like technical books, university papers and websites. 
This, as helpful as it has been, has not been enough to have a better understanding on the subject.

\noindent The Applied Functional Programming course seems to be the best option to fulfil my goal, given that this 
course is not only going to cover the Haskell language, but also will cover the theory behind it, theory that 
would help their participants have better insights and understanding of the purpose of many properties of Haskell. 

\noindent Students will receive lessons from one of the most notable professionals in the area, with 
their many papers, they have contributed significally in the development of concepts, techniques and ideas on the functional
programming field. From this facts, this course seems as one of the best options to get introduced to functional programming.

\noindent As the time pass by, it becomes more evident the importance of the functional programming paradigm 
to solve problems of concurrent and distributed nature; as a developer who wants to work on the development of 
projects related to this area, a language like Haskell seems to be a very important asset, this added to my 
affinity with the language, and the professors involved makes this course a \emph{must} do.
 
\noindent I look forward to meet you and other great developers, and learn as much as I can there.

Until then.

\closing{Best Regards.}
