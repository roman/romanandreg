            I'm a Software Developer who lives in the beautiful city of Vancouver BC. My goal is to produce simple usable quality products that fits into your needs, using Open Standards and Open Source tools that costs nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
Because the Web is a big jungle, applications will be develop to support the long variety of browsers used out there (at least the popular ones), squeezing out the best from the new ones, and making it work nice on the old ones.
          </p>
          <p>
Agile practices for software development will be used to develop the projects, so feedback and code quality is a main concern (code quality left behind will be a <em>no-no</em>). With the use of agile practices, you will be more in control on the development process of your project, and at the same time, you will have a more understandable and reliable code base that can be easily taken by other developers that might join in the future.

          <h2>The Details</h2>
          <p>
So, do you want to know more about me? Well, I'm a Ruby evangelist who embraces the use of Open Standards for Web development, and at the same time, a committed developer to the Open Source community trying to make some difference in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
Starting in 2002 with studies at the Computer Science branch in <a href="http://www.ucv.ve/"><em>Universidad Central de Venezuela</em></a> (Central University of Venezuela), I began to get passionate about algorithms, operative systems and high level problems. From that point on, the commitment to know as much as possible from this branch was getting bigger. 
          </p>
          <p>
In 2004, a half-time course was added to the goal list, studying by the hand of <acronym>IBM</acronym> on the "Training for development of e-Business applications" course. After the accomplishment of finishing the course with IBM in 2005, it was time to start to develop at a professional level, working at some places inside the university and later, on different companies, such as <a href="http://www.terabrain.com/">Terabrain Communications</a>, and <a href="http://www.hasmanydevelopers.com/">has_many :developers</a>, developing first-class applications for clients world-wide.
          </p>
          <p>
Between 2004 and 2007, with the help of <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/?last=Bernadas&first=Jorge">very</a> <a href="">talented</a> friends of the team <em>Guayoyo</em>, I started to compete on the <a href="http://cm2prod.baylor.edu/login.jsf">ACM ICPC</a>. After a lot of effort and perseverance, <em>Guayoyo</em> won several prices on regional competitions, achieving a spot in San Antonio, Texas (2006) and in Tokyo, Japan (2007) for the ACM ICPC World Finals. <em>Guayoyo</em> was one of the 82 other teams that achieve this, from a field of 6,000 teams competing at 198 sites worldwide and representing 1,700 universities from 84 countries.
          </p>
          <p>
After graduating in July 2008, I moved to Vancouver BC. developing first class applications for clients world wide.

As you may know, the Web has a lot of options for tools of development, some of them are free, some others are not that free. In our case, we will be working with high quality Open Source technologies, highly used in the Web today.
          </p>
          <p>
Starting with the Client based technologies, I can work with the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Javascript: <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://mootools.net">Mootools</a>, <a href="http://prototypejs.org">Prototype</a>
            </li>
            <li>CSS: <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            On the server side, I can work with the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ruby: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>, <a href="http://www.merbivore.com">Merb</a></li>
            <li>Python: <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a></li>
            <li>Servers: <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://nginx.net/">Ngnix</a></li>
            <li>Databases: <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a></li>
            <li>Cache: <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">Memcached</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
Besides that, I can make some protocols work for you, these might be
helpful for making your app more popular, like 
<a href="http://www.openidexplained.com">OpenID</a> or <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
In case you are wondering, this page was made with a dash of Mootools, and a large dose of Google App Web Engine ;-)
