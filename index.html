I'm a Software Developer who lives in the beautiful (and rainy) city of Vancouver BC. My goal is to produce simple usable quality products that fits into your needs, using Open Web Standards and Open Source tools that costs zip.
          </p>
          <p>
Because the Web is a big jungle, I will develop the applications to support the long variety of browsers used out there (at least the popular ones), squeezing out the best from the new ones, and making it work nice and dandy on the old ones.
          </p>
          <p>
I'm advocate on the use of agile practices for software development, so feedback and code quality is a main concern (code quality left behind will be a <em>no-no</em>). With the use of agile practices, you will be more in control on the development process of your project, and at the same time, you will have a more understandable and reliable code base that can be easily taken by other developers that might join in the future.

          <h2>The gory details...</h2>
          <p>
So you want to know more about me? Well, I was born in September 21th 1985, in Caracas, Venezuela. I've played with computers since I was kid, with my oldest brother on our first XT Turbo (8Mhz, 20 MB of RAM); from then on, I always used the computer to play on-line games and check the e-mail or chatting. 
          </p>
          <p>
After I graduated from High-school, I started to study at the Computer Science branch on <a href="http://www.ucv.ve/"><em>Universidad Central de Venezuela</em></a> (Central University of Venezuela) starting in 2002. From there I began to get passionate about algorithms, operative systems and high level problems. At some point in my career (2004) I started a half-time course with <acronym>IBM</acronym> called "Training for development of e-Business applications".
          </p>
          <p>
After finishing the course with IBM, I started my professional career working at some places inside the university, later on, I started to work in <a href="http://www.terabrain.com/">Terabrain Communications</a>, and after that in <a href="http://www.hasmanydevelopers.com/">has_many :developers</a> developing application for clients world-wide.
          </p>
          <p>
At the same time, I was participating in the <a href="http://cm2prod.baylor.edu/login.jsf">ACM ICPC</a> with my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/?last=Bernadas&first=Jorge">very</a> <a href="#">talented</a> <a href="#">team</a> Guayoyo representing our University. We competed against all the universities of the North Latin American region (Colombia, Venezuela), obtaining the firsts spots that enabled us to compete on the world finals for two years in a row.
          </p>
          <p>
After graduating in July 2008, I moved to one of the prettiest cities I've ever seen, Vancouver BC. Since then, I started a new career as freelance developer and Open Source developer.

          <p>
As you may know, the Web has a lot of options for tools of development, some of them are free, some others are not that free. In our case, we will be working with high quality Open Source technologies, highly used in the Web today.
          </p>
          <p>
Starting with the Client based technologies, I can work with the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Javascript: <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://mootools.net">Mootools</a>, <a href="http://prototypejs.org">Prototype</a>
            </li>
            <li>CSS: <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            On the server side, I can work with the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ruby: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>, <a href="http://www.merbivore.com">Merb</a></li>
            <li>Python: <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a></li>
            <li>Servers: <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://nginx.net/">Ngnix</a></li>
            <li>Databases: <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a></li>
            <li>Cache: <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">Memcached</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
Besides that, I can make some protocols work for you, these might be
helpful for making your app more popular, like 
<a href="http://www.openidexplained.com">OpenID</a> or <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
In case you are wondering, this page was made with a dash of Mootools, and a large dose of Google App Web Engine ;-)

rots is a ruby gem that allows easy testing for <a href="http://openidexplained.com">OpenID</a> consumer implementations.

This server was implemented with the <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/" >Rack</a> middleware for easy spread.
